My first game made with the Godot Engine!

## Disclaimer
This game was partialy made with the help of the [awesome tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0713nlQxU7I) by [HeartBeast](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrHQNOyU1q6BFEfkNq2CYMA). For now I'm using his assets and core mechanics, but I'll modify them later ;)

You can check out HeartBeast's game on [this repo](https://github.com/uheartbeast/simple--heart-platformer).
